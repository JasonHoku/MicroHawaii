Techniques &amp; Tactics<br></span></h4><p class="c1"><span class="c3">It is especially crucial to dedicate a long period of time daily to the sole purpose of getting thoughts out of the mind and sharing them with people that you find to be especially good listeners who you can discuss every value, depth, eloquence, limits, points and details about every idea, subject, question, concern or point that one can muster. This is an essential standard foundation to the growth of every individual. As humans we rely on and are so deeply woven into our superpower of cooperation and teamwork that without it we wouldn&rsquo;t be human beings and we wouldn&rsquo;t have parties or parents or friendships or togetherness and THAT is why I have opened this research document with Meditation &amp; Consciousness&hellip; A powerful pair of ideas that have moved mountains together and through dedication, understanding, and focusing on thought, expression and feedback people continue utilizing the powerful catalyst for discussion, learning and collaboration and will do so for as long as we can pull off environmental resource management through study, education, action and regulation.</span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Meditational exercises for finding inspiration, discussion, growth, passion, direction and just about everything you can think of are all naturally occurring process that has been wildly revered, praised, noted, focused on, shared, glorified, defined and popularized to the point where it branches prolifically into our societal economy with many forms of value resulting in vast ranges of fields of study, industries, professionals, educators, researchers, discoverers documentation, philosophies and and an ever growing collection of knowledge and questions all born through the power of focused thought. The heart of all art, science, invention and personality&hellip; Meditation a word that many believe it&rsquo;s meaning is to clear one&rsquo;s mind&hellip;However, I believe meditation is better to be seen as more synonymous with focus. Although clearing your mind is one of the many powerful forms of meditations which brings focus point to a higher state of self reflection, casting out the distraction of input, witnessing your own thoughts and consciously relaxing the mind which is a powerful and necessary tool that synergize and rely on its opposite, which are action and focus meaning it is a practice to be taken in moderation as reflection is as important as expression so experiment often with focusing on many different questions, ideas, feelings, and allow yourself to be inspired by the conclusions of your meditation as you navigate and familiarize the utilities that nature has manifested upon the reader.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of us are only beginning to learn about unlocking the true power and potential of meditation. As we slowly direct the intention of our being our abilities shift, genes change, organs were born, society manifests, people invent and procuration of the most fascinating inventions and ideas are birthed.</span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Meditation is a skill of focusing on a specific idea or goal. Sometimes answers do not come immediately and sometimes answers do not get answered fully right away, so it is important to revisit great ideas and questions often. Scheduling, regulation, ritual and repetition are powerful exercises that when combined with meditation, will accelerate the potency of the exercise therefore conscious work towards developing a strategy for efficient moderation and a variety of daily activities is highly recommended. </span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Writing is a powerful meditation and a great way to get your mind and body focused on a creative language exercise which strengthens many points of personality and wellness. Drawing, Painting, Music, Sculpting, Acting, Gaming, Gardening, Exercise, Diet, Work, Sleep are all highly revered forms of meditations with studies, writings, opinions, declarations and conclusions galore about them. In this generation there is no shortage of skill sets. Finding your favored forms of meditation is all about explorating, studying, learning and inventing alongside the vastly growing collection of human declarations. <br></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">If you haven&rsquo;t questioned, weighed, evaluated, judged, understood and governed a behavior you posses, it is quite likely it is of relative subconscious nature and can be grown into a stronger trait through refinement, consciousness and meditation. Many people have so many great talents, abilities, skills and characteristics that could be benefiting them but have not dealt with subconscious barriers that rule their behavior, therapy(in its many forms) can often bring these subconscious systems to light by juxtaposing ideas that lead the mind into revelatory places, healing and repairing old beliefs that have in some cases anchored themselves deep into the foundation of who people are and why they do what they do. Well formed meditations, dietary resources, and a persistent and rigorous education are the best medicines for growth when revelations are called for.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The art of forming and discussing opinions with a variety of perspectives is so pivitally crucial to the evolution of the relationship between the self and society that I recommend daily exercises and tactical action on the subject in a variety of different measurable manners to best develop the skills clearly and effectively. Methodology for training the mind for better brainstorms can be practiced in a plethora of different ways. Personally I&rsquo;ve witnessed most people getting their brainstorming naturally through social interaction, gossip, side talk, and cultural norms of the such but harnessing the core of the exercise and applying it to a more refined, effective, measurable and moderate regulation will result in rapid social ability growth and can open many doors for networking, sharing, learning, growing, understanding and healing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point to make is that in this modern age of digital information sharing, the internet can be a powerful place to get feedback on your ideas and productions. From video-blogs to podcasts, tweets, reddit and many more groups and forms have organized structure to allow the specialized and revolutionarily rapid connection of ideas through online discussion. This allowance for unprecedentedly &amp; historically rapid communication has paved possibilities into the modern media. Though the internet and it&rsquo;s utilities potential for good is astounding, our young society still has much to learn and overcome before we can trust anything we see online and great deals of research are required before accepting suggestions as factual. Brainstorm &amp; Share on finding where your trusted knowledge is developed as it is a great factor into getting truth, righteousness and goodness to overcome ignorance as we evolve out of primitive emotions and into harmonic actualization of the entirety of society. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choosing where to share can be tricky and the places that give the best feedback often require a very big portfolio to get the attention of&hellip; But there are potential friends everywhere doing all sorts of different things with all sorts of different opinions! A true friend adds to content you create though it is important to have several and to consistently be making new friends and discussing everything about life and health and science and education with as many people as possible to ensure the highest quality growth and health of a society and its individuals.<br><br>Be a radical and not an extremist</span></p><h3 class="c15" id="h.ivc6ukmsq0xj"><span><br>2.) </span><span class="c27">Exercises &amp; Health</span><span class="c13"><br></span></h3><h4 class="c9" id="h.om21ka45bra5"><span>&nbsp;A.) </span><span class="c22">A Science to Essential Nutrients<br><br></span></h4><p class="c6"><span class="c3">One must understand that nutrition is the foundation and key to life. For whatever one&#39;s goals are there will be equal nutritional needs. Consuming difficult to process substances commonly like excessive sugars, carbohydrates, brake dust, gasoline exhaust, dust and other toxins can wreak havoc on the body and different types and nutrients are required to process these toxins than are required to say&hellip; run a marathon or feed your mind and soul or recover from cancer&hellip; <br><br>Dietary experimentation is highly prevalent in modernized earth civilizations, many utilize references of individuals of great success and accomplishment to get ideas for experimentations with their own bodies for their goals&hellip; In this section there are lists of facts, research, and priority ideas about the subject of nutrition.<br><br>After concluding the above paragraph, one might wonder what types of nutrition are needed for the lifestyles they are desiring and if they are getting the most efficient fuels to accomplish the jobs they want to do. And if one is wondering such ideas, one would next need to define what they are looking to accomplish out of this life. Many have pitched many a dreams towards the measurement of success and many even share boundless goals amongst one another which are communal and essentially so systematically woven into individuality that the bridge between the self and community is truly an omnidirectional force of nature which exists within peace and harmony and are directly correlated to the development of one another and thus must be considered deeply when embarking on the journey of self actualization or realization of definition.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3"><br>From heroes to athletes there&rsquo;s new books (how many?) on diets being published constantly across the globe, famous stories make their way along the telephone wires and vibrating through the air on bandwaves that flicker faster than 4e+9 times per second, that&rsquo;s 4000000000 or four billion pulses a second in flashing lights with little scribbles on them, automated and efficient, communication is enhancing the rate of learning that people are discovering new nutrients, diets, goals, poisons, medicines and theories on the definition of successful nutrition. The only thing that we can all be sure of, is that everybody is different, and your body is the only body that can tell you what you need, so if you&rsquo;re testing new diets and changing your nutritional regime, it is recommended to do so with caution, ease, slowness, and lots of listening and feeling your body as you do so.<br>I personally would recommend to consume nutrition out of the sole goal of being the best team member you can possibly be to your community. From this point of view, toxins, taste compulsions, and bad diets and habits are especially distasteful and this technique can be incredibly motivating for healing, growing, loving and so many growing processes. <br></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>Did you know that 98% of the planet doesn&rsquo;t know what types of proteins they need and how much of each?

There is abundant evidence that complex interactions among these various neurotransmitter systems are more the rule than the exception, making their study very difficult. Disruptions in the levels and balance among the neurotransmitters contribute to the cognitive impairments associated with many psychiatric disorders, such as depression, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and with neurological disorders, such as Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.
