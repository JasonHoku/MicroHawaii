- [Advanced Guides](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html)

# Setup, Step 1.

Install Prerequisites:

NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/
git: https://git-scm.com/downloads

# Download Source Files For Web App & Set Up Project Workspace.

## A) Get files with git:

Type into git bash in the desired setup directory (git install prequisite):

git clone https://github.com/JasonHoku/MicroHawaii

Now you have the source code and may edit and run it as a React app.

## B) After making changes, upload changes to the group git repo by running the following git commands:

\*note, change "your message about changes here" to a description of the update

git add .
git commit -m "your message about changes here"
git push

## The Private Personal Passwords File

Find example.env in your project root directory and rename it to .env
This file is set to be auto excluded in sharing and will be your passwords and keys file.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
